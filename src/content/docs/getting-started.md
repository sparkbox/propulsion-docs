To get started with Propulsion, first head over to the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/sparkbox/propulsion) and
select the **Use this template** button to quickly create your
own copy of the repo, otherwise, download the project as a ZIP
package under the **Code** dropdown.

### System Requirements

Propulsion requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) to be installed in order to run.

If you do not have Node.js installed already, DigitalOcean maintains a curated list of
[installation instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial-collections/how-to-install-node-js?cmdf=node+js+installation+guide)
for various operating systems.

All other dependencies will be installed in the next section.

### Install Dependencies

Once you have your copy of Propulsion downloaded to your computer,
open up the directory in a command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

The installation will download and install all necessary dependencies into a `node_modules` directory in the project folder.

### Running Locally

To work on your copy of Propulsion locally, open the project folder in the text editor of your choice.

Then, to run the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will build the project and start a server, which is accessible at [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080). Open that URL in a browser to review and test design system build.
