title: Why Propulsion
order: 1
---

Propulsion is a design system documentation and pattern library tool built on the versatile [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator. With this foundation, Propulsion is able to handle every templating language Eleventy can support including, but not limited to, Nunjucks, Liquid, Handlebars, and Web Components. What’s more is through Eleventy's powerful configuration capabilities, Propulsion can handle practically any other templating language (even your custom templating language), as well.

### Who is Propulsion For?

Propulsion is built for teams that need a design system that is framework- and platform-agnostic. Many design systems are built with an expectation that the organization uses a similar tech stack, and often, that is not true. Propulsion’s static site documentation helps put a focus on the design patterns, instead of the tech stack. By utilizing Eleventy’s built-in support and extensions, Propulsion is able to support practically any templating and build structure.

In short, Propulsion is for teams that need to support many or an unknown number platforms, frameworks, and tools across an array of products.
